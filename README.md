# agent
simple GUI and Layout profiles for jmb

not cleaned up - adapted another agent into current Basic as of 1/5/2021.  Templates got messed up switching things into Basic, didn't take that much time with it - just added a couple skins files.  Tested it a little - if you are not running the game in C:  you might have to change some includes.
